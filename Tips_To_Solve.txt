Array:
  - Use minus sign to flag the index.
  - Use value which will represent index in same array.
  - Replace array values to some unique value to simplify operation.
  - Keep only values which is in range of 0 to N (size of array).
  - Use sorting to reduce time complexity
  - Use Treeset to reduce time complexity
  - Use HashMap to reduce time complexity
  
String:
  - First convert into char[]
  - String traversal for left and right in substring
  - String partition
  - String converts to char[], then mentained the char count in HashSet/HashMap which helps to solve.
